Based localStorage

## Window.localStorage

The localStorage property allows you to access a local Storage object. LocalStorage is similar to sessionStorage. The only difference is that while the data stored in localStorage does not expire, the data in sessionStorage has its data cleared when the page session expires - that is, when the page (tab or window) is closed.
